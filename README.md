# Abstract
The following project presents an in-depth analysis of a Supply Chain Management System, exploring its various components and their interactions. Through data analysis, visualization, and machine learning techniques, this project aims to enhance understanding and decision-making within the supply chain domain. The project offering insights into the potential improvements in efficiency, customer satisfaction, and overall operational effectiveness.

# Scope 
The Supply Chain Management System project encompasses the development and implementation of a comprehensive digital platform that streamlines the end-to-end supply chain processes. This includes order management, inventory tracking, supplier collaboration, demand forecasting, and logistics optimization.

# Objectives
-	Analyse the existing supply chain processes to identify opportunities for improvement.
-	Implement data preprocessing techniques to ensure data accuracy and consistency for analysis.
-	Utilize visualization tools like Tableau to create insightful dashboards for monitoring key supply chain metrics.
-	Apply hypothesis testing to validate the effectiveness of process optimizations and improvements.
-	Segment customers based on order history and preferences to tailor supply chain strategies.
-	Perform ABC analysis to prioritize products based on their impact on overall supply chain performance.
-	Build machine learning models that predict the likelihood of late deliveries.
